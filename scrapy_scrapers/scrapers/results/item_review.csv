5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great starter set weight set for a great price. A few things to know; You should take some time to clean the threads because they have been machined and may still have some metal fragments that will cut. I used a wet rag and finished with WD40 to protect the metal.  The plates will fit on any standard weight bar, so I also purchased a long bar to complement the weight set. I also plan on purchasing additional heavier weight plates because loading the ten pound plates can get tedious after awhile. But overall, this is a great starter set of weight plates and dumbbell bars to purchase."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price I couldn't find anywhere local that could compete with this product. This would be a 5 star product if it had a standard diameter bar for weights. Realistically, the 100lb set is fine and I don't think I'll ever need to add weight to it. If I did, I would sell this one and upgrade to the 200lb set.My weights came with no weird smell, not chipped, all the same size, and weighed pretty close to true on my less than perfect scale. For me the kurling on the grip is just right.There is a rubber gromet that sits in the locks that will come out stuck onto a weight plate. It helps lock the nut in place. The weights work fine without this piece as long as you check that your weight is secure (which you should always be doing anyways).Even though the description has the measurement of the bar I'm still docking it a star."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty easy to work with; my only gripe is that there are only 5 and 8 plates while I would prefer more variety. If you want to increase the weight on it you can only go by 10 at time in this way, because you need 2 weight for each side of the dumbbell.So you can have as weight 10, 16, 26, 36 or if you join the 2 dumbbells, you get 60 pounds (assuming the bar and the connector add 8 pounds, since you have 4x8lbs and 4x5lbs plates.The image is pretty much wrong, when you use the connector; you want to add all the weights on the outmost area, and you can use it for chest press for example, but if you just join the dumbbells you end up with your hands in between weights and they most likely will hinder your movements or hit on your chest when you exercise.In the end it is a well made set; you pay something when you have the flexibility to use them as separate or connected, but it works perfectly fine for my needs"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Beware! The package it comes in is extremely heavy. I could break my toe if I dropped it. There is also a sticker on the package that says ""package weighs 35 or more"".I ordered the 40 lb with connector and it is so worth it for me! I lift somewhere around 7 to 10 lbs here and there with dumbbells. I love how I can easily assembly and adjust my weights. It's also safe to where the weights won't slip out either! The connector makes it easy for me to turn a dumbbell into a barbell for squats or deadlifts. I think the bar for the dumbbells itself weights about 4 lbs. I wish there was a way I can buy the weights separately in case I want to add more weights to my sets."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely nothing wrong with the quality of this 200lb set!  And far more cost effective than buying individual, wieghted dumbbells.  I bought two extra pair of the 1.15"" bars for $43, and now I have a 45lb pair, a 35lb pair, and a 25lb pair, and of course, can build a heavier pair as I work up to it.  This method saves a lot of time that would be involved in changing out the weights.As for the Wimps who complain that the ""spiny-ness of the grips hurt their hands... seriously people? Man-up!  They are no different than anything else on the market.  These are very good quality!  If your hands are that tender, wear workout gloves."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Edited 5/24: just received the barbell connector and extremely dissatisfied. Threading doesn’t match (I couldn’t even get a half thread engagement, no set screws as shown. After reading other similar reviews I’m sending the connector back and buying a 1” barbell from elsewhere. Had to turn my 5 star review into 3 stars after being do disappointed in the barbell adapter I was looking forward to.Easy to assemble and switch out plates - and fills the rest time between sets if you make a weight adjustment in your training.  The only drawback is the shaft where you add plates can hinder range of motion if you're doing lat pulldowns on the floor, but I have a weight bench on the way to remedy that and also to allow full range of motion for chest exercises.  I was happy enough with this set that I went ahead and ordered the barbell adapter piece.For those concerned- they did split the weights into separate boxes though I will still put out a gift card for my mailman for hoofing them up 3 flights of stairs!The only suggestion I have is the ability to order additional plates separately - I could use a few 10lb plates once my strength is back from getting so weak during quarantine, but couldn't quite justify the 190lb set since I can certainly get by with 105 total for a while. For the guys out there I would definitely recommend the 190lb set though."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"You can't beat these! I've had my eye on these dumbbells for a couple years. Unfortunately COVID happened, and they went out of stock. I was finally able to snag some at a decent price (not the scalper prices we've all been seeing), and I am totally impressed. They arrived in well-labeled, secure, sturdy boxes, with plastic bands around them to keep them safe, with each plate individually wrapped in plastic bags. The finish on the product is terrific --- no loose paint or chipped edges. The knurl is great, not too rough, not too light. My seller sent them via USPS 2-day priority, and USPS put them right on my doorstep in 3 boxes plus a small envelope (arrived early too). The boxes came in perfect condition, not unlike some other reviews you've seen. I am thrilled with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ONLY bought the adjustable kettlebell. While the price it was a bit more than I’d like to spend, admittedly I am a cheapskate. Anyway, I am an experienced from home lifter. Previously, I had purchased an all iron adjustable kettlebell. Overall, this is a much better product. Here are the pros/cons vs. the all metal version:Pro - the kettlebell locks well. With the all metal version, they did not lock very well and I had 40 lbs drop on my toes on a side to side kettlebell swing. Also, the handles work great to use for pushupsCon - the handle weighs next to nothing as it’s plastic. The downside is there is a lower weight limit to the kettlebell so if the plan is to lift very heavy you would need to use 25 lb plates which make the kettlebell pretty sizable. Also, this is all plastic so imagine the handle has a shelf life.Overall, this is a better option than the all metal adjustable kettlebell handle."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was searching for a set of good dumbbells for a while now since I can't go to gym for 3 months now and the lack of weight inventory out there in the market. I tried both Powerblock and Bowflex but they are out of stock since Covid19 hit.Not sure if I was lucky, over my countless searches, this shown up in my AMZ page. Clicked on it and they only have the 200lbs set available, I immediately hit purchase without even thinking because the PRICE is unbeatable (I got double the weights but half the price comparing to Bowflex/powerblock).And it was delivered to me a week faster than AMZ estimation even in this Covid19 situation, and kudos to USPS that delivered to the front of my house. It was well packaged (double packed) and secured.I got it today and immediately tried it out, it works as expected and well. Finally I am able to lift weight again after a long 3 months of searching for dumbbells.My conclusion, you can't beat this price for what you get and it's a quality set, seller even provided extra rubber o-ring in case the existing one wear off in the future."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been asked by my wife the past two years to go and hit the gym in an effort to lose body fat and build muscle mass and strength... I made an effort to work on that and have been doing so this past year. I purchased several sets of adjustable dumbbells(thankfully so considering the many COVID-19 shutdowns) and it is paying dividends. Avoid the gym and purchase a set of adjustable dumbbells, and if you want to build mass, simply purchase heavier weights with your dumbbell set. It is price friendly and time friendly as well. Anyone who tells you that you need fancy equipment or big barbells to build muscle is not true. You can most certainly get ripped and build mass with an adjustable dumbbell set, a few resistance bands and body weight workouts. Of course, your workout plan and nutrition is key, with nutrition being the most important."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"These basically do the job, though I got metal splinters from either the dumbbells or the barbell attachment.The ""black paint finish"" arrived chipped off in the plastic bags for several of the weights due to the lack of any separators or padding between the plates during shipment.I would have preferred that the dumbbells had a larger diameter, like in the gym, for a more comfortable grip. These seem to be about 1"".  Maybe that's the case with these home sets.EDIT;  Rating raised to 4 stars.  Company has excellent customer service and helped us with the product issues."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought this was going to be pretty ""meh"" but I was actually impressed to see a rubber gasket on the end-caps to prevent slipping, and a set-screw that allows you to lock the end caps so they don't loosen up over time. much better than the cheap-o walmart ones. only negative is that the grip is really rough. I wrapped the grop with cloth tape so that it wasn't so hard on my hands."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"My biggest issue with these weights is actually with the handles.  I've been using the 200lb set now for 1.5 years and overall, they are a very good set of weights.  You can't beat the price.  The problem is that the chrome plating on the handles flakes off and I believe its just because of sliding the plates on and off.  The flakes are generally harmless, but on occasion I have had a couple of very small specks of chrome embedded in my palms that I have to dig out.  To boot, the chrome flakes are all over the floor and you have to be careful because they are sharp.My advice to the manufacturer would be to ditch the chrome and paint the handles a matte black.  Otherwise its a good set."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, came in a couple different boxes. Big issue with this type of system is the time it takes to unscrew the collar X 4 collars. You cant put these square on your legs when prepping for an exercise. You have to put them mostly hanging off your leg. Otherwise good product for a budget home gym."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was really skeptical of these, but you can't beat the price. I was shocked that those with the protective silicone covers were CHEAPER. They arrived yesterday, and I've had two workouts with them. Easy to put together, good quality. They smell fine and are not oily (had seen similar complaints on competitor products). Will probably be getting another set in the next few months."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I couldn't find ANY weights at a price-per-pound this good except rusty, used ones. Even single-piece dumbbells almost always cost more than this. Unlike some other reviews, my star collars tighten down very snugly and the texture on the bar is pleasantly grippy without being rough. Slight bummer that it's an uncommon diameter size for the heavier weight sets, and this is probably over-doing it for flat-rate boxes. But I just finished my first work-out with them and they're just plain good. Unless you want to pay 3 times the price to get Bowflex's slick adjustable dumbbells, this is it right here."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"So I only gave it a 4 just because the fit and finish isn't that great. They aren't what you'd expect to find at a gym. But for home use and the price, they are solid. Definitely a good value. When I opened them there was some flakes of paint in the box, but I put them together outside and there were no other problems. Spinners go off and one easily and lock down well."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a high quality set, with everything well machined. No rough casting edges here, it's all smooth and the collars thread onto the handles very smoothly and quickly.One thing to be aware of that was not clear when I ordered. According to my scales, each handle with its collars weighs 4.9 lb.That's not a problem for me since these were intended to move up incrementally from a set of fixed hand weights that top out at 5 lb each.With the assortment of weights in this set I can increase weights gradually as far as I'll ever manage."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"They're solid, secure, and just about the most bang you could get for your buck. I didn't get any weird oils or smells, the package was split in 2 boxes and safely package, and it arrived on time.This is where you should start, not with a gym membership. If you can get your workout done 10ft from your laptop and xbox then you're training your discipline, which will save you wasted gym money in the long run."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"These were pretty good and by far the best deal on Amazon for weights of this kind. My two complaints are: 1) The grip on these is pretty rough; you definitely need gloves if you're going to lift any substantial amount of weight or do so regularly with these bad boys. And 2) the ridged part where the cap screws on is pretty long, so if you don't have a ton of plates on these, they basically have metal poles sticking out which are easy to poke yourself with when doing a shoulder press or bench press. You get used to it, but beware on your first few lifts! You'll poke your eye out, kid."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The dumbbells look quite good, very well crafted and I'm expecting it'll do what its intended to do, be heavy of course. I'm only giving 1 star because I'm missing the connector that is said to come with it, and I don't appreciate being shorted on the things I buy. I can't seem to find a way to get in contact with the seller, so this is my call for help, so to speak."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't know how to give different ratings for features.  It's the overall use that sucks.I am using just 40lbs for dual curls and no matter how hard I tighten, WITH the rubber rings inserted, they come loose after just 10 reps.  I cannot imagine doing 20 like I normally would without them falling the heck apart!  Speaking of the rubber, I bought these to quickly change between weights.  Forget that, it's useless if you don't want to spend enormous amounts of time between sets.  Get modular weights with proper locking.These are nownpapee weights and might sell on Craiglist to just dump them for half the price."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don’t get me wrong, these weights do exactly what they’re intended for. I just wouldn’t purchase them again because it’s impossible to find extra weights for the 105 or 200 lb set since they went with a 1.15 inch dumbbell diameter. Yes4all doesn’t even sell the 1.15 inch weights and I haven’t been able to find anything that works, I wouldn’t buy these again if I had the option."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Aight Good things first:- They arrive pretty quick- They are weights 🤷🏽‍♂️- They did not break on me (been 2 weeks i’ll write again in a month check replies)- They can be easy to assemble- Holding these bare handed ain’t no problem but gloves would be A1 (perfect)- If you a lil dude trynna get some muscle no caps these good.- You can Add all weights on (60lbs)Bad Things:- The screw thing at the ends always loosening Mid-work out (the things that hold the weights in place) no matter how tight you tighten it, could just be mine. (any suggestions go get that amended?)- Really Heavy Package (duh) for me atleast 😅 for now though ..I really don’t like the fact that the screw piece gets loosen so yea that’s the rate i gave it solely because of that.PS. I hope the pictures upload"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fantastic, especially considering the price/weight ratio. The only downside I found was that there most definitely is a smell. Anyone who cannot detect a smell should go see a doctor. Note to seller: clean these things!!! Anyway, other than that, they are great. The weights come off and on easy enough, and although the rubber seals tend to fall out, I haven't found them to be absolutely necessary."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"These look and feel like quality dumbbells.  The grips don't dig into my hands as other weights have.  I enjoy using them.  What I don't like is that they are long.  When I do bench presses, the ends of bars are long enough that they get in the way.  I don't lift heavy, so an individual using more weight plates may love the 16 in. bars.  Changing plates is a little slow because both ends must be unscrewed and then weight plates adjusted and then replaced.  Sometimes the star-lock collars come loose, so it is important to check that frequently.  My biggest frustration is that I cannot purchase individual weight plates with 1.15 in. center holes because the company does not yet have them available.  I did contact them and they said such a product will be available in the future.  I have not had much luck finding other weight plates with 1.15 in. center holes.  They do make smaller barbells (14 in.) that take weight plates with 1 in. center holes, but not with the larger number of weight plates."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used these for about 2 months (I have the 52.5lb) now switching between the dumbbells and the connector (for barbell use). It has its pros and cons depending on how your workout is or the routine you have.For Drop Sets/super sets/Pyramid etc:Anything requiring little to no rest time, like super sets or drop sets is a hassle to change weights. Changing between heavy/light weights takes time, you unscrew both ends for each dumbbell and load/unload weights and screw them back again making sure everything is tight so it doesn't come loose while in the middle of a set (we'll get to that later). It's time consuming and maybe not for you if you're looking for a quick effortless change in weights. This is where a select tech like bowflex is highly recommended (if in your budget).Straight forward set in weight workouts:If you have a routine where you stick to a certain amount of weight for your sets, have longer rest periods, and only change it whenever you start a new exercise, this is probably more for you. Compared to having multiple weights of dumbbells, this is a good option for space constraints, price if on a budget, and variety in weights.The connector:It's a great add on to have if you don't want to spend on a normal barbell. You connect to the dumbbells by screwing it on the ends. As convince as it is,  its also a hassle to use. You have to screw it (connector) on one dumbbell then screw the other dumbbell into the connector, which can be tiresome if you set up with heavy weight. Switching between dumbbells and barbell can be a hassle and time consuming. The grip and width of the connector is great, better then the dumbbells in my opinion. One thing i'm not a fan of is when you need to load the weights on the inside, you lose space for feet placement if you do certain exercises.The Dumbbells:They get the job done compared to having no weights or a cluster of several pairs of dumbbells. The grip is okay but for myself the handle is a little too thin, wish it was as good as the connectors grip and width. I'm not a fan of the ends, I understand given the function of these dumbbells and the use, but you can't rest them on your legs if trying to set up for bench press of any sort because they dig into your legs and stab you. You have to be a little more careful setting them down on the floor/yoga mat/pads with the rod sticking out, they can rip them up. This is where I feel other select tech dumbbells have an advantage since the ends are flat and can be rested on your legs.They get loose so much! The star lock collars are not that secure, and the screws to what i think is to ""better secure"" the locks are pointless, not sure why they exist (you can still unscrew the locks them off). I tighten them hard and tighten the screws up, but they still loosen up in the middle of my set and it throws me off. I do notice that the more plates you use the faster they loosen up. Especially when rotation of the dumbbells are involved like curls, flys, lateral raises, any of those i would have to tighten back up after every set, sometimes in the middle of a set because they came loose and had the plates shifting. It's even worse with the connector! It's a distraction when you have to worry about weights falling off or plates shifting throwing off your balance.I think I've rambled off long enough here, overall they have their Pros and Cons. As I stated in the headline, it will all depend on what your use for them are (how you will workout), but also your budget and versatility.Pros:- More convenient to have then several pairs of different dumbbells (space saver).- The price, if you buy at a good time, is worth it compared to buying several pairs which get more expensive the higher the weight you choose.- The connector to turn the dumbbells into a barbell is very useful and affordable.- overall look of the dumbbells are nice- Grip on them are goodCons:- Time consuming and hassle changing the weights (especially when dealing with the connector)- The more weight you add the faster they loosen the star locks, I would have to tighten them at least after every  set. It was very distracting.- The end of the rod/spokes are inconvenient and painful for any resting on the legs or body.- Shaving of the silver plating on the handles and connector is often. flakes of silver is left on the ground after using the connector.Overall not a bad set of dumbbells. Would I recommend them? Again, it would depend on the person and what they will use them for. As a beginners set and space saver sure, its a great deal. For a more advanced level, I'd say there are better options, but you can still do a good amount with these."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm by no means a power lifter or a hardcore workout guy. I use these to tone and build a little muscle and keep in shape. I outgrew my previous set that only went up to 25lbs per hand so I needed something that can increase incrementally but not buy an entire individual set up to 100 lbs, so this was the perfect option for me. I don't have to switch the weights a lot, but it's very quick to do. It takes me maybe a minute to swap out the plates for each hand.Once properly put together, the plates are fastened snugly and I've had no problems with slipping or loosening. I use them for curls, lateral raises, benching, squats, etc (probably using the wrong terminology here lol). As long as you don't drop them on the floor, the threads should hold very nicely and not give you issues. As always, I'm very careful with my items so I rarely drop or bump things, so I'm unable to comment as to whether these can take abuse or not.All in all, a great price for versatile equipment that's sturdy and just what I needed to progress my workouts."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not purchase from this company.  They refuse to give refunds if you are not happy with the product and then Charge you half of what you paid to ship them back.  Very disappointed with this seller.  I am a loyal amazon buyer and this has been the first time I have had a major issue with a seller.  There are many other companies that sell great dumbells and so I would def go to those.  The whole process of loading up the weights and removing them is cumbersome and the weights do not stay stable they wobble which makes for not a pleasant work out.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Edited my review:  the collars are terrible. Nothing like being on your 5th rep and the weight is sliding all over the bar because the collar keeps spinning loose. Look elsewhere for a better product.As advertised. All the weights are there. Two bars for setting up various weights. Issue is the collars don’t work well. The weights constantly spin loose which is frustrating. I’ve tried the collars both ways without any luck. Also have cranked them very tight and they won’t stay.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"These weights work just as well as any you might use at the gym, so are a sound investment if you work out regularly. There is enough room on the bar for expansion of plates, which is nice. The only thing I disliked about this product was that one of the collars continuously comes loose on me. It is not coming so loose that the plates fall off, but I still dislike the fact that I will tighten the collar only to find it loose some minutes later, regardless of how loose it becomes. This suggests to me that the quality of the product is not as high as it could be."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is great for working out!  I bought these because I was trying to find a way to get a good workout at home.  For the price and for the convenience of having just these pieces, I definitely think it was a good buy.Pros:The composition is good.  It does not feel flimsy or cheap.  The bars are sturdy, so the weights don't feel as though they will bend or break.The grip doesn't hurt my hands; I've never had to wear gloves or any hand protection.The weight, depending on how you adjust it, is enough for me to do arm workouts, and also do lower body ones as well.  I am 5'2 and 120 pounds.Adjusting the weight is easy too, you don't have to be a rocket scientist.Cons:If you are someone who is looking to put on serious muscle, you will probably need to find a heavier weight.If you are doing a circuit and need different weights, you will have to go back and forth adjusting the weight.  This can be annoying and slow you down.If you are doing an exercise where the weight must be held vertically, you may have the actual weights slip a bit down and loosen the tightener."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"You can't beat the price on these dumbbells. Simple and clear, these are exactly what they say. They come brand new so watch for the black coating to scuff off a bit on whatever surface you put them on. Fortunately I noticed it on my hands before they ever touched the rug. Sure it would be nice to have the auto changing sets, but who can afford that extra convenience. These are all ya need!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"PositivesThe dumbbells are as advertised. Easy to load and change weights, the screw cap with rubber gasket is a breeze to set and change. Very good for the money.NegativesSlight gripes are the screws come slightly loosened during normal use.  Although this isn't an issue, there is no danger of them coming off completely, I can see them being damaged over time. Possibly needing replacement and I don't believe there are any for sale. So if these don't hold up over the years this purchase might not have been worth it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these while on quartine to try and keep up with the moves I learned in CrossFit. These dumbbells are perfect. I love that the weights are adjustable and fit under my coffee table. The handle is a little rough but works out if you are one of those people that sweat a lot. It will keep it from slipping out of your grip. Money well spent.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Quality seems really great.  I really like the old school feel.  These can be set anywhere between 5 lbs and 52.5 lbs in 2.5 lb increments.  The fittings are high quality.  The knurl is really good.  These are perfect for my son.  The only thing I would want for myself, being a bit older, is I like a bit of an ergonomic rounding-out to the bar, which these to not have.  But the old school gym feel of these is very cool and functional.  Well done!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"These were a great concept; bought them for my girlfriend because she wanted a set of dumbbells and a barbell, and this was everything in one. Immediately regretted the purchase when she went to use it and the plates had sharp edges and a splintering outer layer that cut her and splintered in her hands. Don’t buy. Spend a little extra and get a nice set of weights."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these.  I have been using them for about a week and couldn't be more pleased.  It is fast and easy to change out weights.  I don't find the bar to be uncomfortable at all as some people have reported.  I find it very comfortable and like the anti-slip of it.  They are long as others have stated, but it hasn't bothered me at all in any of my exercises yet.  Great value!  Easy to use!  Perfect for me!Each shipped in a different box that was secured completely.  The boxes did not rip or tear.  All the pieces/weights were in each box when they arrived.  Shipping was fast too!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The description and title is a bit misleading...You get the following,4x 7.5lbs plate4x 3lbs plate2x 3.5lbs handle4x 0.5lbs collarAll total 51lbs but can only make two 25lbs dumbells. The 25lbs was stated in the description but they failed to mention 4.5lbs of the 25 was the star nuts and handle. For someone that is buying these solely for the plates like myself you only get 42lbs of plates.The handles also are covered with sharp jagged edges that can scratch or cut you regardless of how ""strong"" your hands are like other reviews state. It's so bad that there are two stickers on each handle warning you about being scratched."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these dumbbells to work out with during quarantine while the gyms were closed. It gets the job done, just some cons with it that is why its only 4 stars. One of the negative things is that its a hassle to keep twisting the ends to add or subtract weight so that in itself is a tedious workout. also the end stoppers have a tendency to get look and twist on their own when you're working out. One thing to note is that the handles are rough and will callous up your hands so just keep that in mind if your hands are sensitive or you don't want callouses."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great dumbbells BUT impossible to add weight!!!If you will never be able to lift more than 52.5 pounds in each hand, these dumbbells are excellent.BEWARE, however, that they are SPECIAL MISFIT UNICORNS that have 1.25 inch hole weights and dumbbells that will never accept the 99.9% of available weights on the market that have 1.0 INCH holes!Having said all this, I continue to use these dumbbells for shoulder and arm workouts and light chest and back workouts.  If I need to do rows or bench presses with more than 105 pounds, I will head to the gym.Alternately, I could buy a second set of dumbbells with 1.0 inch bars and weights for heavier workouts...this is what I recommend for people who want heavier weights and options."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased the 50lb set..its easy for beginners which i am. I would recommend it for someone looking for a at-home inexpensive experience... I don't know if it would be favorable for a more experienced person who works out regularly & needs heavier weights but this set is work a try!
5.0 out of 5 stars,This dumbbell set is a great value. Everything is solid and works as advertised. The large screws don’t necessarily stay tight over time but it is absolutely not a problem and for the money you’re paying it’s a fantastic deal. As far as the screws go just squeeze them tight and they will work fine you just have to tighten them every so often but it will not get in the way of your work out whatsoever. I don’t think there a better deal on the market. I am about to order more weights to get more from my set. I’ve been using them every day.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price you can’t beat these. I’ve been using them a few weeks and they’re great. As others have said, the boxes they were shipped in were torn to hell with multiple holes, but I got lucky and everything was inside."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly as described. Jus what I needed with gyms being closed due to corona. Had to take a file to one of the 5lb plates as it had a defect and wouldn't fit on the dumbbell but wasn't a problem for me.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lots of weight for not much money.  Doesn't get better than that.  I have had no issue with the handles being too rough or the weights looking banged-up.  They're weights, shouldn't they look a little banged-up anyways?"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a great find for me with this all Covid thing going on. USPS without attempting to deliver it asked me to pick it up from post office.  First attempt - Undelivered, The reason was myailbox was small lol. But other than that these are great dumbbells. Bars are little longer than expected."
4.0 out of 5 stars,One thing to note is that the edges of the plates are pretty square so its easy to pinch fingers when adding more plates vs other brands with rounded plate edges. I did notices a tiny bit of metal flakes when first using but nothing a simple rinse of the hands in water didnt fix. As far as odors go theyre average to better than average about not having an excessive odor due to stuff to prevent rusting.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Good cheap weights, but after a couple uses, the cheap chrome coating starts to flake off. Sometimes you'll brush your hand against a sharp edge on the handle and it will embed a splinter then. Other times you'll be walking and step on one of the flaked off chrome pieces and have a chrome splinter embedded in your foot. Sometimes they're even too small to see, so getting the splinter out is a pain.Once COVID-19 is over, I'll be switching to boflex adjustable weights; the chrome flaking off is just too much of an issue."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have two of the 52.5 lb weights. They work great and are easy to adjust. I wish the black finish coat was more durable. It seems to chip off very easily.  I'll eventually have to sand blast and powder coat but other than this, they are great for the money."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice only complaint is the star lock comes loose sometimes and you have to tighten it again and again but the weights are great for the price just get a different dumbbell bar if it annoys you great set of weights none the less
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product! Not greasy and comfortable grip without using gloves. Yes, the threads are a little long when it comes to doing overhead presses,  etc but I bought the CAP threaded barbell and can use these weights on that. No more gym memberships for me!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"The handles, collars, and plates are good quality. I have fairly small hands and the thickness of the handles is good for me. What I don't like about the 50 lb set is that the only 2 types of plates you get are 3 and 7.5 lb. That means that you can only go from adding 6 lb to adding 15 lb with nothing in between, which is a pretty large jump."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Each dumbbell adjusts from 5 to 52.5 lbs. Knurling is pretty wild but if you have calloused hands you'll be fine. Sometimes the star clips will come slightly loose when I'm swinging them around (snatches and such) but never to the point where it's a safety issue. 5/5.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Took about 1 month to ship and the dumbbells are poor quality, the screw to secure the weight is very loose, the plate almost hit me head during a fast motion."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered the 105 lbs set and received two 52.5 lbs adjustable dumbells in separate packages after 4 days.Pros:• Handles feel solidly built and are textured to prevent slippage.• There is room for additional plates to increase each bar's weight beyond 52.5 lbs (though you'd need to buy those separately.)• The spin-lock system is easy to use. After a bit of practice I can adjust the weight on both bars in <10 seconds, which is about the same amount of time it'd take to rerack weights at the gym and pick up a different set.• At <$70 + shipping, these are a steal.Cons:• The black paint on the plates is flaky and chips easily. These honestly would have been better off without any paint at all.• Slight odor after unpacking, however this is a very minor issue as the odor went away after about a day.Because of the flaky paint, I'm keeping these on the patio for now, but I wouldn't recommend you leave these outside unless you live somewhere with very low humidity; the chrome should protect the handles from rust, but if it gets scratched or chipped then the cast iron underneath could become corroded anyway.All that said, these adjustable dumbbells have the absolute best value per dollar of all the sets I looked over. I can't recommend them enough if you're trying to set up a home gym on a budget."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT, ARRIVED VERY WELL PACKED AND THE HANDLES ARE STURDY.  EASY TO ASSEMBLE AND GREAT PRICE AS WELL. I RECOMMEND THIS WEIGHTS."
5.0 out of 5 stars,These are perfect for my husbands use. He had tricep surgery in November and needed very light weights to use to strengthen his left arm. But he still wanted to work out his right arm which is still very strong. These made it possible. He is gradually increasing the weight in the left while using the full weight capacity in his right.
5.0 out of 5 stars,High quality weights at a good price. Since purchasing this set I have bought additional weight plates and adjusted the weight up. The ability to change the weight of these dumbbells is a great feature over the long-term.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Arrived on time and packaged well for their weight. Son loves these to work out at home when he can't make it to the gym.  Started with lower weights and worked his way up to match what he does at the gym.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great value for money, pretty well made except for a few sharp-ish bits on the weight castings. These were easily filed down. Packed well and delivered fast."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This dumbbell set is my third one; the other two are different brands, one of which I have owned for over thirty years; it is solidly built and the plates lock-in tight."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Durable! Knurl is very rough so be ready for calluses. Weights can handle the 80lb weight.I don’t use the adapter too much. Kind of a bit awkward so you don’t really need it honestly
5.0 out of 5 stars,This was a great deal when I purchased them sad to see them increase something like 5 times what I paid. I should have bought a double set.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Good buy for 200# set. Went with the heavy set so we wouldn’t out grow the weights! Well made and a good price! This set shipped in three boxes.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are perfect for my boyfriend because there isn't much space for him to workout. It's compact, easy to assemble, and store away."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Product arrived on time as promised and everything looks great.  Just started using them and will update my review once I had the chance to further evaluate.  As you all know fitness equipment, especially dumbbells are very hard to find now at a reasonable price these days. I got this set for ~$150.00 and arrived this week about a week after I ordered as promised.  So far so good!!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,Good weight deal for the money. The bars however can be too long to perform certain moves so best advised to such activity in front of a mirror to avoid risk of hitting your head.
4.0 out of 5 stars,easy to add plates to barbell. like that the weight is printed on each plate. my last set didnt and it was constant guess work. so far im really enjoying these!
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a great cheap set but don't buy them if you don't want what you pay for. The paint chips and the handles are not that comfortable. You may have tape the handles and you may have to sweep up paint chips but you did just get a basic weight set for only 60 bucks that gets the job done what more do you want.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Very easy to set to the amount of weight that you want. They are easy to hold and to grip.  I have not had any rips on my hands from these either.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for the home workout. Heavy duty and solid. Easy to change weights. Will last for years to come.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I regret purchasing these. Upon my first use, I got a really painful metal splinter from these when I was simply adding the weights on. Because of its location on my palm I wasn’t able to use the dumbbells until the splinter wound healed. The manufacturer should have sanded down the bars to remove the sharp metal pieces hanging from the edges. I will have to use sandpaper to do it myself. Do not recommend."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the 40# set and they are great! Very well made set of dumbbells... would definitely recommend. The UPS guy who had to carry the box up 2 flights of stairs, might disagree!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality especially for the price. The weights are 21lbs total and the bar and clamps equal 4lbs to give each dumbbell 25lbs of weight. So 50 total lbs.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven’t used them too much yet, but for the most part I haven’t had any complains about the weights."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"These weights are great, especially for the price the only problem was that the star collars were the wrong size but luckily I had extra ones and was actually able to use them otherwise definitely worth the money."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Great product but I just noticed that they sent me 3-8lb plates and one 7.5 plate. I also got 2-5lb plates. So essentially my dumbells are 30lb and a 25.5 lb each. Check before you use them! It's only a half pound but still.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great, high quality weights! Easy to put together and apart. The paint is chipping a little but not a big deal."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Only received one bar for weights. Don’t know what happened with order, didn’t get correct weights, I ordered 50 lbs and got 40."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered 60 pounds total and only 52 pounds arrived (8 x 4 disks, 5 x 4 disks)..."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered this for my 16 year old son and he loves it!  He’s been using it everyday since he got it.  His friends have even asked where I got it.  It’s very sturdy!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this for hubby and he loves it. Good quality. Wi have it for years to come
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So if you compare these dumbells to other adjustable dumbells, these are harder to adjust. the reason this had an edge over other adjustable dumbless is that you can attach it to the bar to create a barbell. I don't mind the hassle of adjusting my weights over the convenience of exercising home"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Handle is a bit thin, which I consider as a neutral moment: concentration on holding is also a good exercise. Main problem is that holding lug can get loose especially if someone in the family relocates these by rolling; every time forced to check if its tight enough.If price is right - go for it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered the 40lb set. It is great. Easy to switch weights. I just started adding weight training and this set is perfect for me.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this along with the dumbbells thinking it would be a great option to transition into a barbell. It won’t even screw on to the end of the dumbbells. Looks like the treads are completely different. Wish I wouldn’t have waited this long to try it since now I can’t return it. Waste of money
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Affordable, good quality weights.I’ve been using them for a couple months now and I’m very happy with how they’ve held up."
5.0 out of 5 stars,These are really awesome and very easy to install and good quality. Really liked these for the price the offer.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"great deal, especially for being shipped. I don't like how large the diameter the 10lb plates are, but not enough for a bad review"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I don’t usually purchase things more than 50 bucks online but I am so glad I bought these!! Best weights I’ve ever owned and at a great price. I highly recommend these!
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Broke after 2 weeks. The idea and design is cool, but this adjustable kettlebell has plastic spindles and a plastic threaded middle part. This material will not last long term. I will probably buy some metal alternatives I saw on Amazon. Also, somw of the images in description seem to be for a different product. I got the adjustable kettlebell."
1.0 out of 5 stars,The screw is not tight enough. The weight discs will fall off easily
5.0 out of 5 stars,Extremely good quality for the price. You could use these everyday and never run into a problem.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like it. It is designed to do what it was supposed to do.  The locks can get loosen when you roll the dumbbells a little but as long as you remember how to tighten it, you are fine.  Paying 1 dollar per lb. Is a fairly decent price.  I'm not too picky about how it looks, it gets the job done."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly as described. Very sturdy better than sand weights. Good for and starter.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for when you share weights with someone who lifts more than you do! Easy to change out and easy to grip.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice looking nice painting.. durable materials solid colors nice grip.. very easy and confortable at the hand
2.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband was only able to put together one of the dumbells, it was missing parts. We had to go to academy to find them."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Ordered 2 dumbbells which arrived two days apart. One of the boxes were ripped open from the travel but all the weights were present. All in all the dumbbells are great. Customer service for yes4all responded in about a day which is pretty good. I would definitely recommend!!!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,I used it on a boat. Some times I don't like to spend extra time for replacing waits. But over I like it!
4.0 out of 5 stars,"For the money they are a great value. Don't expect Olympic quality, but they are a decent set for a good price."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Use them all the time
3.0 out of 5 stars,The rods have too much left over length after the weight are put on.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Gr8
3.0 out of 5 stars,Not a fan of the paint smell when I lift the weight close to my nose. Otherwise good weights
4.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality product. Im glad I bought it.
4.0 out of 5 stars,I use them nearly every day for exercising. Very satisfied. The only downside is you do have to tighten them constantly.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the versatility of these weights without having to take up the extra space required for multiple weights.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"product came as expected, also earlier than expected. like it very much !"
3.0 out of 5 stars,The barbell clamps unscrew on these very easily. If you're just looking for weights to lift these are the cheapest alternatives.
4.0 out of 5 stars,The only thing stopping them from getting 5 stars is that they won't sell a connector bar individually. I hear they also won't sell individual weights. But the product is otherwise everything I want.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice set for price paid.
5.0 out of 5 stars,These weights are perfect for home training they quickly turned my studio apartment into an effective home gym I’m a long time lifter and I love the raw true gym feel of these weights
5.0 out of 5 stars,They work great. The weights are secured tightly. the black paint did flake of a bit when they first arrived.
5.0 out of 5 stars,ok
5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are well built, can be added to and perfect for my home gym. I just put in an order for the bar that connects them together. Will be getting more weights as I go along."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice product, thank you!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well packaged and easy to setup and go. Didn't have much of a smell that other were talking about, but I wiped it all down once over anyways."
2.0 out of 5 stars,The weights arrived extremely chipped and damaged. I was very disappointed in the poor quality when compared to similarly priced competitors.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great easy to adjust you can do two 8 five pundits weights for 45 pounds (5 pound bar), or you can do one dumbbell at 75 pounds."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them!
5.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered the 105lb weight set and they arrived within 3 days of placing the order! There was virtually no odor. I’m doing a second round of 80 day obsession and really needed those in between weight sizes (like 17.5). This was the best deal to get all of those instead of buying individual dumbbells
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, great value."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Lot of weights at good price. Good finish.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product for the price. Just as advertised and works well. Only (minor) flaw, which is explained, is that the size is not ""standard"" and hard to find extra weights or replacement. Look into it before purchasing. I am happy overall."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Good value for the price. Totally intend on toning up with these
5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent quality dumbbells.  I was unsure based on the price but I was pleasantly surprised to see just how solid and well built these are.
5.0 out of 5 stars,AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE! ASWOME PRODUCT
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The product arrived on time but with only one star collar. This ultimately makes the product unusable since there is nothing to hold the weights on one side in place. Otherwise, this does appear to be a quality product."
1.0 out of 5 stars,The painting on the dumbbells start flaking off and even got stuck in my friends hand. Even started rusting on the weights that is... P.S I have been storing them in dry areas
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Paid For 105 lb. weights- Received Only 85 lbs. Poor Quality Also. As it was a Christmas Gift So, I had to Order elsewhere- to make it Good!!! Do Not Buy “Yes4all” You will be Disappointed—"
5.0 out of 5 stars,My husband loves the ease of adjusting the weight for different exercises.  The big selling point was the connector bar that allows the dumbbells to be turned into a barbell.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, I guess my heading is kinda self-explanatory. I've been looking around for weeks before deciding on this because most dumbbells are reviewed as being stinky, flimsy or they are simply too expensive. This is a perfectly normal dumbbell, works to my needs, gave it 4 stars as I have not tried adding on the 7.5lbs weights yet."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got 60lb pair and can’t ask for a better quality for the price, I had to wait for almost 2 months for these to arrive but worth the wait, definitely recommend."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice build to them. Lock seems to loosen after a few sessions but nothing you won't notice and screw back tighter. No worries of it coming loose and dropping on your foot lol. Other than that, great weights."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"These weights have been helping get into shape. They're simple, to the point, so no needless flair. Having them shipped to me was a bit of a hassle since the box came open with two pieces missing: a collar to hold the weights and a light weight. It took the company a bit but we're able to help me out!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,They're prefect! Totally love that they're adjustable and you can either add or take weight off the dumbbells depending on what workout you're doing!
5.0 out of 5 stars,This 60 lb dumbbell is a good one. It was sent in a set of paper box.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for the price, very well made and very heavy, after I ordered them I got them 2 days later, much better and a lot cheaper than the adjustable dumbbells that cost upwards of $300-500. This is a much better buy!!!!!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect at home workout equipment! Good to use to add some strength conditioning right in your own living room!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Got exactly what I wanted
5.0 out of 5 stars,The product arrived fairly quickly and the quality of them is good and i can see it lasting a long time. all pieces came in one package. so far so good !
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well built, good product!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"just got these and used them a few times.  it's a pretty basic product, but the materials are good quality, the manufacturing is clean, the wing-nut screws on smoothly... I'm pleased with my purchase and for the price, consider it a good value."
1.0 out of 5 stars,The paint started chipping right out of the box and gets everywhere. Super annoying to clean up.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are looking for straightforward dumb bells these fit the bill. Solid bars, solid screw on collars. The weights are nice. I use these for a variety of arm workouts from standard curls, to butterflies, rows, etc."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got my order of these dumb bells i ordered the 105lb set and yes they do come in 2 different packages,i am still waiting for the 2nd package not a big deal.I have noticed on some other reviews that the plates give off some sort of an odor/smell,chipping paint from the plates,well i haven't noticed any paint chipping yet but i have left my first set in the garage but when i put the weight to my nose i did smell i slight smell or odor like a paint or something but not something i could smell instantly,probably not that  bad that i noticed it straight away.The weights are just under 1"" thick.The reason i bought this set was for home use for me and my wife when we can't go to the gym.Its nice simple starter dumbbell set.I will update a further review when i get the 2nd package and have used the both dumb bells.Just wanted to edit my review i did get the 2nd package about 4 days after the 1st package came.Started using the dumb bells and i like them great so far."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Adding additional plates does not fit.  The center hole is too small.
